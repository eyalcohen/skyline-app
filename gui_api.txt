This documents the DNode API used to communicate with the Web App.

DNode methods:

General parameters:
  sessionInfo: session information as supplied in web page and stored in
      ServiceGUI.sessionInfo.  Used to confirm valid user session.
  vehicleId: 32-bit integer vehicle ID.
  channels: a channel name string, or an array of channel name strings.
  cb: a callback.
  err: first argument of a callback; instance of Error, or null.
  time: all times are in microseconds since the epoch.

Structure of samples:
  All samples:
    beg: begin time,
    end: end time,
    val: value,
  General numeric channel:
    val: number,
  Merged numeric samples (only returned when minDuration > 0):
    val: number,
    min: optional minimum value, if getMinMax is true,
    max: optional maximum value, if getMinMax is true,
  Schema samples:
    chn: '_schema'
    val: {
      channelName: channel name, e.g. "frontWheel.speed_m_s^2".
      humanName: human-readable channel name, e.g. "Front wheel speed" (optional).
      units: string describing units, e.g. "m/s^2" (optional).
      description: long human-readable description (optional).
      type: the type of the channel, one of:
          'float', 'int', 'string', 'raw', 'enum', 'object'.
      enumVals: if type == 'enum', a list of possible values for the enum.
      merge: true if samples which abut or overlap and have the same val
          should be merged into a single sample.
    }
  Wake level:
    chn: '_wake'
    val: an integer, where >= 1 indicates that the system is in an active
        state where the user is likely to be interested in the data.  For
        example, for an electric motorcycle, we might use:
          0: key is off, bike is sleeping.  Data is infrequent and less
             likely to interesting to a person.
          1: key is on, throttle is not live.
          2: throttle is live, bike has not moved since key turned on.
          3: throttle is live and bike has moved.

fetchSamples - Fetch samples.
fetchSamples(sessionInfo, vehicleId, channelName, options, cb)
  options: {
    beginTime, endTime: samples overlapping this time range will be fetched.
        If either is null, that end of the range is considered unbounded.
    minDuration: if > 0, only real samples of this duration or longer will
        be returned, with synthetic samples used to fill in.  Defaults to 0.
    getMinMax: if true, min and max values are returned for synthetic samples.
    subscribe: pass a string value to start subscribing to this channel.
        Whenever new samples are available within the provided time range on
        this channel, the callback will be called with the new samples.
  }
  cb: callback function
=> cb(err, samples)
  samples: [
    { beg: begin time,
      end: end time,
      val: value,
      min: optional minimum,
      max: optional maximum,
    }, ...
  ]

cancelSubscribeSamples - Cancel a subscription.
cancelSubscribeSamples(handle)
  handle: the string passed to fetchSamples.options.subscribe.

TODO:
  getVehicles(sessionInfo, cb): get all vehicles accessible to current user?


Design principles:
  - Due to incrementally adding to drive cycles, schema, etc, there may be
    samples which are wholly contained by equivalent samples.  The smaller
    samples are redundant, and should be ignored.
  - Records are never deleted/modified unless they are redundant.
  - Drive cycles are only expanded when new data has arrived.
    (Hmm, can Henson ensure that data is uploaded in this kind of monotonic way?
    Probably not...)


Intended client operation, no subscription:
  - On page load, sessionInfo is populated in page, and vehicle list is
    populated in page.  (Could be fetched...)
  - For each vehicle, maintain a cache, keyed on (channelName + minDuration +
    timeRange), of data fetched.  Whenever requesting new data, fetch missing
    bits from server and return it from the cache.  Need interval arithmetic
    for tracking cache contents...  (Alternately - cache buckets?)
  - On vehicle expansion, call getSamples(..., '_cycles') to get all drive
    cycles.  Update the timeline to view the latest cycle.
  - When timeline time range is updated, and we have no schema info cached:
    Fetch schema info with getSamples(..., timeBegin, timeEnd, '_schema').
    Use schema to populate channel menus.  Pick starting channels to display.
  - When displaying a channel, fetch channel data from cache.  Based on zoom
    level, pick a minDuration from SampleDb.syntheticDurations which results in
    a reasonable number of pixels per sample.  Request samples on the given
    channel with that minDuration.
  - When zooming, whenever we need a different minDuration, request data at that
    resolution.

  TODO:
    - When panning, visible schema changes.  Tricky.
    - When doing dynamic updates, how do we handle cache invalidation & new
      data?

With subscription:
  - Modify cache to track active channels:
    - '_cycles' for all time.
    - '_schema' (for simplicity, for all time, could be more efficient to just do it for viewed regions?)
    - Channels which are currently viewed, at current minBucket.
  - When '_cycles' changes, notify Overviewer.
  - When '_schema' changes, notify Timelines.  Be careful to only update menus
    when something truly changes?
  - When a channel changes, notify affected Timelines.  If new data is visible,
    display it.  If new data crosses right edge of graph, scroll (or zoom?)
    graph to make new data visible.
